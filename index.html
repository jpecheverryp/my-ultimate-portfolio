        <h2>About Juan</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! My name is Juan P Echeverry, a full-stack developer. I am
          currently looking to continue my coding career by getting a full time
          job in the tech industry. I graduated in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack
          Web Development bootcamp where I learnt how to use both Front-End and
          Back-End technologies as well as using important tools like VSCode,
          Github and the terminal command line. I love to learn more and more on
          my own using resources such as Udemy, YouTube and a few different
          books

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem-Solver:</strong> I think that every problem, no
            matter how big can be solved by breaking it down into smaller
            problems. This process can transform a big problem into small simple
            tasks that you can tackle one at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend Tech:</strong> I have worked with user interfaces,
            and I understand the huge role that accessibility and responsiveness
            have in a web application. I know that interfaces must be intuitive
            to use for everyone no matter who they’re or where they’re from.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend Tech:</strong> I understand that a web app is a
            machine with different parts. The database model and the API routes
            have to be well structured to communicate properly with the
            interface. I am familiar with relational databases such as MySQL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Team Player:</strong> I love working in a team, I am always
            learning from others and helping them to be more efficient whenever
            I can do it. I believe we can get really far when we work with
            others. I also can communicate my ideas and opinions about future
            goals by using graphs or words to better express what I think.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Always a Student:</strong> I see every technology as a tool,
            and I like to learn about different tools to solve different
            problems whenever I need to, I may need a new language or it may be
            a new framework.
