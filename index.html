          Hey there! My name is Juan P Echeverry, a full-stack developer. I am
          currently looking to continue my coding career by getting a full time
          job in the tech industry. I graduated in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack
          Web Development bootcamp where I learnt how to use both Front-End and
          Back-End technologies as well as using important tools like VSCode,
          Github and the terminal command line. I love to learn more and more on
          my own using resources such as Udemy, YouTube and a few different
          books

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Problem-Solver: I think that every problem, no matter how big can be
            solved by breaking it down into smaller problems. This process can
            transform a big problem into small simple tasks that you can tackle
            one at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Frontend Tech: I have worked with user interfaces, and I understand
            the huge role that accessibility and responsiveness have in a web
            application. I know that interfaces must be intuitive to use for
            everyone no matter who they’re or where they’re from.
          </li>
          <li>
            Backend Tech: I understand that a web app is a machine with
            different parts. The database model and the API routes have to be
            well structured to communicate properly with the interface. I am
            familiar with relational databases such as MySQL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Team Player: I love working in a team, I am always learning from
            others and helping them to be more efficient whenever I can do it. I
            believe we can get really far when we work with others. I also can
            communicate my ideas and opinions about future goals by using graphs
            or words to better express what I think.
          </li>
          <li>
            Forever Student: I see every technology as a tool, and I like to
            learn about different tools to solve different problems whenever I
            need to, I may need a new language or it may be a new framework.
