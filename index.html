                  Hey there! My name is Juan P Echeverry, a full-stack
                  developer. I am currently looking to continue my coding career
                  by getting a full time job in the tech industry. I graduated
                  in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp where
                  I learnt how to use both Front-End and Back-End technologies
                  as well as using important tools like VSCode, Github and the
                  terminal command line. I love to learn more and more on my own
                  using resources such as Udemy, YouTube and a few different
                  books
                </p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Problem-Solver: I think that every problem, no matter how big can
              be solved by breaking it down into smaller problems. This process
              can transform a big problem into small simple tasks that you can
              tackle one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Frontend Tech: I have worked with user interfaces, and I
              understand the huge role that accessibility and responsiveness
              have in a web application. I know that interfaces must be
              intuitive to use for everyone no matter who they’re or where
              they’re from.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backend Tech: I understand that a web app is a machine with
              different parts. The database model and the API routes have to be
              well structured to communicate properly with the interface. I am
              familiar with relational databases such as MySQL.
            </li>
            <li>
              Team Player: I love working in a team, I am always learning from
              others and helping them to be more efficient whenever I can do it.
              I believe we can get really far when we work with others. I also
              can communicate my ideas and opinions about future goals by using
              graphs or words to better express what I think.
            </li>
            <li>
              Forever Student: I see every technology as a tool, and I like to
              learn about different tools to solve different problems whenever I
              need to, I may need a new language or it may be a new framework.
