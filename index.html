        Hey there! My name is Juan P Echeverry, a full-stack developer. I am
        currently looking to continue my coding career by getting a full time
        job in the tech industry. I graduated in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web
        Development bootcamp where I learnt how to use both Front-End and
        Back-End technologies as well as using important tools like VSCode,
        Github and the terminal command line. I love to learn more and more on
        my own using resources such as Udemy, YouTube and a few different books
